# Medieval Fantasy City Generator

# Install and run on linux

```
$ ./Scripts/setup.sh
$ ./Scripts/build.sh
$ ./Scripts/run.sh
```

These scripts contain the steps to fetch the dependencies and build the project.
I don't know much about haxe and lime so there might be a much easier way to do things, let me know, I just hacked together something that worked on my machine.

This is the source code of the [Medieval Fantasy City Generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator/) (also available [here](http://fantasycities.watabou.ru/?size=15&seed=682063530)). It 
lacks some of the latest features, namely waterbodies, options UI and some smaller ones. Maybe I'll update it later. 

You'll need [OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl/openfl) and [msignal](https://github.com/massiveinteractive/msignal) 
to run this code, both available through `haxelib`.
